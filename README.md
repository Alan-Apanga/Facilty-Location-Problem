# Facilty-Location-Problem
## Objective and Prerequisites
Facility location problems can be aplplied in many industries, including logistics and telecommunications. In this example, we’ll show you how to tackle a facility location problem that involves determining the number and location of warehouses that are needed to supply a group of supermarkets. We’ll demonstrate how to construct a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model of this problem, implement this model in the Gurobi Python API, and then use the Gurobi Optimizer to find an optimal solution.
